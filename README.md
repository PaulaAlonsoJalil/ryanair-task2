# Ryanair task2 - Paula Mercedes Alonso Jalil

The project is a proposed resolution for task 2 by Ryanair.

**It is not finished yet since I had not worked consuming external APIs, and almost at the end I realized that I could have done the task in other easier ways.**

The /interconnections endpoint with its parameters, example "http://localhost:8084/interconnections?departure=MAD&arrival=FCO&departureDateTime=2022-08-23T21:00&arrivalDateTime=2022-08-22T21:00" returns the list of flights and their routes but they don't have any order.

## Technologies and libraries used in the project ##

	*  Maven
